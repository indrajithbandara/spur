			<h3>what is spur?</h3>
			<p>Spur lets you post and find `moments`.  These moments are kind of like mini-events that are happening anywhere from right this second to 24 hours in the future.   And they can be just about anything: walking your dog, playing a game of halo, going for a run, or even a game of soccer.</p>
